# Genomic Analysis with R in 3 weeks

This repository contains materials for a 3-week course designed to introduce highschool students (9th grade or greater) to data analyisis using R and to the analysis of genetic data using R.

## General Information

   - **Instructor**: Gustavo de los Campos ( gdeloscampos@gmail.com )
   - **Modality**: Synchronous distant learning (via discord)
   - **Required background**: High school student, 9th grade or greater.
   - **Expected time commitment**: 10-15 hr/week. We will meet as a group on Monday (lecture and introduction of the week's task), have office hours on Wednesday, and meet as a group on Friday for presentation of results and discussion.
   - **Other requisites**: Students are required to have access to a computer, have personal Discord (https://discord.com/) and  Github (https://github.com/) accounts.
   - **Disclaimer**: 
      - The course is offered by Gustavo de los Campos. 
      - This is not a Michigan State University course. 
      - Upon completion, you will receive a certificate singed by the instructor.

## Tentative program

  - **Week 1: Introduction to Github, R, and RStudio**
      - Introduction to R: types, conditional statements, loops, plots, arrays, importing/exporting data and other objects
      - Introduction to Github
      - Reporting using RMarkdown and RStudio
      - Task 1:
        - Reading a genomic data set in R
        - Producing summary statistics for phenotypes and genotypes.
        - Report results
        
  - **Week 2: Descriptive statistics and association analysis**
      - Variance, covariance and correlation
      - Simple linear regression
      - Introduction to Genome Wide Association Analysis (GWAS)
      - Task 2:
        - Produce a Manhattan plot
        - Identify SNPs significantly associated with a trait
        - Report results
      
  - **Week 3: Beyond single-marker-phenotype analysis**:
      - Multiple-linear regression (model, estimation, and goodness of fit)
      - Training versus testing accuracy
      - The curse of dimensionality
      - Task 3:
        - Fit a multiple regression model to a training set (we will consider three approaches)
        - Evaluate prediction accuracy in the trainin and testing set.
        - Report results
