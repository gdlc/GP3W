# Genomic Analysis with R in 3 weeks

This repository contains materials for a 3-week course designed to introduce high school students (9th grade or higher) to data analysis using R with a focus on studies involving genetic data.

## General Information

   - **Instructor**: Gustavo de los Campos ( gdeloscampos@gmail.com )
   - **Modality**: Synchronous distant learning (via discord)
   - **Required background**: High school student, 9th grade or higher.
   - **Expected time commitment**: 10-15 hr/week. We will meet as a group on Monday for a lecture and an introduction of the week's task, have a short lecture and office hours on Wednesday, and meet as a group on Friday to present and discuss results.
   - **Other requisites**: Students are required to have access to a computer, have a personal [Discord](https://discord.com/) and  [Github](https://github.com/) accounts.
   - **Disclaimer**: 
      - The course is offered by Gustavo de los Campos. 
      - This is not a Michigan State University course. 
      - Upon completion, you will receive a certificate signed by the instructor.

## Tentative program

  - **Week 1: Introduction to Github, R, and RStudio**
      - Introduction to R: Types, conditional statements, loops, plots, arrays, and importing/exporting data.
      - Introduction to Github.
      - Reporting using RMarkdown and RStudio.
     
      - Task 1:
        - Reading a genomic data set in R.
        - Producing summary statistics for phenotypes and genotypes.
        - Report results.
        
  - **Week 2: Descriptive statistics and association analysis**
      - Variance, covariance and correlation.
      - Simple linear regression.
      - Introduction to Genome Wide Association (GWA) Analysis.
      
      - Task 2:
        - Produce a Manhattan plot.
        - Identify SNPs significantly associated with a trait.
        - Report results.
      
  - **Week 3: Beyond single-marker-phenotype analysis**:
      - Multiple-linear regression (models, estimation, and goodness of fit).
      - Training versus testing accuracy.
      - The curse of dimensionality.
      
      - Task 3:
        - Fit a multiple regression model to a training set (we will consider various approaches).
        - Evaluate prediction accuracy in the training and testing set.
        - Report results.
